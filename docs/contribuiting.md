# Contribuiting to sma-tact-io

Thanks! We appreciate your interest in contribuiting to the project! Currently, the project is on its early stages, so there will always be something you could do to make this something better for everyone. 


How users can get started with the project
How can I develop for this project? We find it works really well if you follow a two-step approach to develop the content for this section: first, help someone setup the site who has never done it before, and then write down the exact instructions. Next, ask someone to follow those instructions and see if you‚Äôve missed anything.

## What to contribuite
Concrete, clearly defined ways contributors could contribute 

1. Improving the documentation (grammar, spelling, diagrams, emojis, translations, etc).
1. Spreading the word, starting or joining a conversation. (TODO: discussion spaces like this? https://github.com/atom/design-decisions)
1. Building the device and sharing your progress/issues/insights.
1. Proposing a cool logo for the project. 
1. Sharing new ways to use or improve the hardware.
1. Adding more tasks to this list!
1. Eventually, we will add project tasks, when we do, take a look at them to see if there is anything you would be interested in doing. (TODO: add project tasks).

## Before contribuiting
1. Link to basics of contribuiting if you are new to contribuiting, also a discussion tab for newcontribuitors. 
1. Check out the [README](/README.md) of the project, pay attention to the *VISION* section, to familiarize with overall goal of the project. 
1. Read and follow the [Code of conduct](/docs/code_of_conduct.md).
1. If you are making changes to the hardware design files, consider reading the [hardware license guide](/docs/hw-license/hw-license-howto.pdf) and adding a brief description of your changes to the [change log](/docs/rd/changes.md).
1. Remember that as the project matures and grows, this guideliness will evolve, so come back to this document from time to time. 

## How to contribuite
TODO: adapt [atom's](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/docs/contribuiting.md) contribuition guides (style, suggesting enhancements, pull request, etc.).

## Mainteiners
Please consider that I am currently the sole maintainer of the project, and although I will try to keep it updated every day, it might take me a while to get to your issues, contributions. However, I would be happy to accept anyone that agrees with code of conduct as a maintainer, to help out with as much or as little as they want. 
Please PM me, or send me an email at [LibreTactile](mailto:libretactile@gmail.com). 




Happy making!

If there are any additional setup steps specific for development.
Whether there are explicit Instructions for running tests before contributions are accepted.
If there are any requirements for contribution, if any, e.g.
A Contributor License Agreement
CLAHub

http://contributoragreements.org/
If commits should be squashed
Whether there is a specific coding style to adhere to. (Generally contributors will match what they see within a project.)
Whether potential contributors should ask before they make significant changes.
Whether work-in-progress pull requests are ok.

# HOW TO USE ORGANIZE/include FILES

  It is best
to archive the files using a format everybody can open. Schematics and layouts
should be included in both source form and, should the design tool be proprietary, a
format readable by everybody, such as pdf.
The following documents must be distributed together with the hardware design
sources:
- Document containing the CERN-OHL-P v2
- This Guide
- A text file (plain ASCII file), where information can be added to but not
removed from, noting that the design has been changed, and
providing a date and information about the changes made by Licensee
(see section 3.3.b of CERN-OHL-P v2) (e.g. CHANGES.TXT). A detailed
list of changes would be helpful, as would a diff, but a description of
the changes (e.g. ‚ÄúAC/DC power converter circuit removed as AC input
no longer necessary‚Äù) is fine.
